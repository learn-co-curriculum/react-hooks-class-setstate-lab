# Class Component State and Events Lab

## Objectives

- Practice refactoring function components to class components

## Instructions

In this lab is the working code from a previous lab, using function components.
If you run the tests now, they should all pass, except for the tests checking
that you are using class components instead of functions. Your goal is to
refactor all the components in the `src/components` directory to use classes
instead of functions, and _still_ have the tests passing.

Start by familiarizing yourself with the code and the functionality, then work
through each component and convert them to class components.

Make sure to pay attention to syntax (and in particular, `this` and arrow
functions). Also make sure you are initializing and setting state correctly.
